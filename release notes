# 🚀 Gordian Nexus Constitutional Engine (GNCE)

## **v0.6.1 — Release Candidate**

**Release Date:** December 2025
**Version:** v0.6.1-RC
**Status:** Constitutional Kernel Stabilisation Release
**Codename:** *Aegis* — the point at which the system becomes defensible

---

## Executive Summary

GNCE v0.6.1 marks the **completion of the sovereign constitutional kernel** and the **stabilisation of the federated evidence plane**.

This release transitions GNCE from an experimental governance engine into a **deterministic, contract-bound decision system** capable of operating independently, producing regulator-grade evidence, and safely federating that evidence without compromising decision integrity.

> **Key outcome:**
> GNCE decisions are now **deterministic, auditable, non-repudiable, and sovereign by construction**.

---

## 1️⃣ Constitutional Kernel — Complete

### 1.1 Deterministic Decision Execution

GNCE now guarantees that every governance request:

1. Is evaluated deterministically
2. Produces a complete **Auditable Decision Rationale Artifact (ADRA)**
3. Either **ALLOWs**, **DENYs**, or **VETOs** execution based solely on codified constitutional logic

No external system can influence the verdict.

---

### 1.2 Versioned Constitutional Contract

Every ADRA produced by GNCE now conforms to a **versioned constitutional contract**, enforced at runtime:

* `gnce_contract_version`
* `adra_id`
* `adra_hash` (SHA-256)
* Canonical constitutional layers (L0–L7)
* Mandatory verdict surface:
  **`L1_the_verdict_and_constitutional_outcome`**

Any deviation from this contract results in a **hard constitutional failure**.

This guarantees **forward compatibility without silent breakage**.

---

## 2️⃣ Evidence & Audit Integrity

### 2.1 Cryptographic Identity & Non-Repudiation

Each ADRA is:

* Canonically serialized
* Cryptographically hashed
* Immutable once produced

The ADRA hash acts as a **global, content-addressed identifier**, enabling:

* Replay
* Verification
* External audit
* Legal defensibility

---

### 2.2 Chain-of-Custody Safety

GNCE v0.6.1 guarantees:

* Decisions are finalized **before** any export occurs
* External failures cannot corrupt or alter internal state
* Evidence generation is isolated from transport concerns

---

## 3️⃣ Federated Governance Plane — Stabilised

### 3.1 Sovereign Federation Architecture

GNCE now supports **controlled evidence federation** without compromising decision sovereignty.

Federation modes include:

* **OFF** — No external emission
* **HASH_ONLY** — Minimal proof of decision
* **REDACTED** — Sensitive fields removed
* **FULL** — Complete constitutional record

Federation behavior is governed by **sovereign configuration**, not UI state.

---

### 3.2 Non-Blocking by Design

Federation sinks (HTTPS, S3, local vaults, etc.) are:

* Strictly **non-blocking**
* Fully isolated from the decision loop
* Allowed to fail without impacting GNCE execution

This ensures **regulatory safety under partial system failure**.

---

### 3.3 Cryptographic Idempotency

GNCE enforces **single-emission per ADRA hash**:

* Multiple execution paths
* Multiple UI interactions
* Multiple export attempts

➡️ **One ADRA = one federated emission**

This prevents duplication, replay abuse, and evidentiary ambiguity.

---

## 4️⃣ Operator & Regulator Tooling

### 4.1 ADRA Inspection & Ledgering

GNCE provides:

* Session-level decision ledger
* Article-level policy outcomes
* Severity banding
* Drift and veto visibility

Operators and auditors can inspect decisions **without access to raw inputs**.

---

### 4.2 Regulator-Safe Views

A regulator view mode ensures:

* Sensitive identifiers are redacted
* Constitutional outcomes remain intact
* Decisions remain explainable and verifiable

---

## 5️⃣ Constitutional Smoke Test Gate (New)

GNCE v0.6.1 introduces a **mandatory constitutional smoke test gate**.

The gate verifies, on every release:

* Deterministic ALLOW behavior
* Binding DENY behavior for critical violations
* Contract completeness
* Federation non-blocking guarantees
* Idempotent evidence emission

A release **cannot proceed** if the gate fails.

This creates a **self-defending governance system**.

---

## What v0.6.1 Is — and Is Not

### ✅ v0.6.1 **IS**

* A complete constitutional kernel
* A sovereign decision system
* A regulator-ready evidence engine
* A stable foundation for scaling

### ❌ v0.6.1 **IS NOT**

* A demo
* A prototype
* A policy suggestion engine
* A UI-driven system

---

## Forward Statement

GNCE v0.6.1 establishes the **constitutional baseline**.

All future versions will be evaluated against this release’s guarantees.
No feature expansion will be allowed to weaken:

* Determinism
* Contract enforcement
* Evidence integrity
* Sovereign isolation

---

### Status Declaration

> **GNCE v0.6.1-RC is approved as a constitutional reference release.**
